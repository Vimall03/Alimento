GitHub webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations that subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. When one of those events is triggered, GitHub sends an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks can be used to update an external issue tracker, trigger CI builds, update a backup mirror, or even deploy to your production server. They are a powerful way to automate workflows and integrate with other services, making it easier to manage and streamline your development process.
