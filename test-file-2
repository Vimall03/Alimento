# Secrets in GitHub Webhooks

When working with GitHub webhooks, it's important to secure your webhooks using secrets. A secret is a key that is shared between GitHub and your server to ensure that the payloads received by your server are from GitHub and not from a malicious third party.

## Setting Up a Secret

1. **Generate a Secret**: Create a random string that will be used as your secret. You can use a tool like `openssl` to generate a secret:
  ```
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```

2. **Configure the Webhook**: When you create or update a webhook in your GitHub repository settings, you can add the secret in the "Secret" field.

3. **Verify the Payload**: On your server, you need to verify the payload using the secret. GitHub sends a `X-Hub-Signature-256` header with each webhook payload. This header contains the HMAC hex digest of the payload, using the secret as the key.

Here is an example of how you can verify the payload in Python:
